A fun and simple Python console game where the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100 and you try to guess it! After each guess, the game tells you whether your number should be higher or lower until you find the correct answer. It also counts and displays how many attempts you took. This project helps beginners practice basic Python concepts like random number generation, loops, conditionals, and user input.
